# Knapsak-Problem-Genetic-Algorithm
Solving the Knapsak Problem with Genetic Algorithm

Developed from scratch, for an university project;

Using C/C++, an algorigthm to solve the knapsak problem:

12 itens:
Weights = [5,4,4,2,4,6,10,4,2,8,12,15] Kg;
Values = [3,2,8,4,6,4,12,2,6,10,15,9] $;

Find the optimal combination for carrying the maximum value, withing a 36 Kg limit bag.
